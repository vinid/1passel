# 1 PassEl (Work in Progress)

## Introduction

1passel is a simple integration for 1password into emacs. I find this useful to be used with EXWM. Depends on Ivy to generate a searchable list of accounts from which to retrieve the accounts.

It makes use of the [command line](https://1password.com/downloads/command-line/) interface provided by 1password.

## Commands

1passel exposes two interactive commands

### M-x 1passel-login

Logs to 1password

### M-x 1passel-get-password

Allows the user to search for a password
